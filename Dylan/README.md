Future ToDo:
* play with the model
*  can we include countries, with the intention of predicting the paris dataset?
*  using mean, or dropping null values?
*  how much do null values affect it?
* change features in the completed_combined
*  only include features with >25%
*  subset of years?
*  subset of countries? >50% participation? only if gold medals = True?
*  double check feature importances and use the top?
* multiple model crreation at one time
