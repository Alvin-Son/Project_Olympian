### **Background**

- The Olympics are a time when the world rallies behind their flag and hope its best athletes succeed over every other country. Winning is a source of pride, not just for the athlete competing, not for the athletic associations that trained them, but for every person in that country. But does a country’s economic and political situation affect how well it will perform in the Olympics?

### **Motivation**

Wanting to see whether or not a country's political, economic, health, stability plays a role in how well top athletes perform. Will hardship spur on a drive to success, or will these stressors negatively affect their performance? It would be interesting to see how these relatable struggles inspire or hinder the best of the best athletes.

### **Purpose**

Use a combination of country development indicators to find correlation as we as predict how well a country performs in the olympics.

### **Questions to answer**

- How do Economic Conditions Influence Olympic Performance?
- What Role Does Political Stability Play in the Consistency of Olympic Medal Wins for Nations?
- How Do Natural Disasters Affect the Training and Performance of Athletes Leading Up to the Olympics?

### **Tools/Modules to use**

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Scikit
  - Preprocessing
  - scaling
- Tensorflow (keras)
  - Hyperparameter adjustment
- mongoDB
- Tableau
